# Support for hardn

This document outlines support resources available for the `hardn` project.

## Getting Help

As a solo-maintained project, support resources are limited but focused on helping users effectively use `hardn` for Linux system hardening.

### Documentation

The primary source of support is the project documentation:

1. **README.md**: Contains installation instructions, basic usage, and feature overview
2. **Configuration Guide**: Detailed information on configuration options
3. **Example Configuration**: Located at `/etc/hardn/hardn.yml.example` after installation

### Issue Tracker

For bugs, feature requests, and general questions:

1. Search existing [issues](https://github.com/abbott/hardn/issues) to see if your question has already been addressed
2. If not, create a new issue with the appropriate template:
   - Bug reports: Use the bug report template
   - Feature requests: Use the feature request template
   - Questions: Use the question template or label your issue as "question"

### Support Expectations

Due to the solo-maintained nature of the project:

- Response times may vary based on the maintainer's availability
- Critical security issues receive highest priority (see SECURITY.md)
- Bug reports are addressed before feature requests
- Feature requests are evaluated against the project roadmap and maintainer bandwidth
