</p>

## What is it?

A simple hardening tool that automates basic security configurations for Debian, Ubuntu, Proxmox, and Alpine Linux. The project is stable and in the **early stages of development**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer

**The scope of current capabilities and support of Hardn is limited.** Regular security audits, updates, and monitoring are still required. `hardn` should be part of a broader security strategy, not a "set it and forget it" solution. While the binary distributions are [SLSA3](https://slsa.dev) and [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) compliant, they are **<ins>not suitable for enterprise deployments</ins>**.

## üéØ Target Audience

Anyone managing a **privately owned** Linux server, container, or virtual machine
- Homelab enthusiasts, Students, Hobbyists

If you are one of the following, **refrain from deploying this tool in the public or private sector**
- System Administrator
- DevOps Engineer
- SecOps Architect or Analyst

## üì¶ Installation

You can easily install the latest release of `hardn` using the installation script. The script automatically detects your host operating system and architecture, downloads the correct binary, and installs it to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Prerequisites

- **curl:** Used to download the script and binary.
- **sh/bash:** To execute the installation script.
- **sudo:** Required for writing to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Install via Script

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abbott/hardn/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

<!-- *Note:* Replace `main` in the URL with the appropriate branch if necessary. -->

The script will:

- Detect your operating system (e.g., Debian, Proxmox, Alpine Linux) and CPU architecture.
- Query the GitHub releases API to find the latest asset matching your system (e.g., `hardn-linux-amd64` for 64-bit Linux, etc.).
- Download the asset and install it to `/usr/local/bin` with executable permissions.

### Updating

To update `hardn` to the latest release, simply re-run the installation command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abbott/hardn/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

### Install Binary Manually

1. Visit the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/abbott/hardn/releases) page.
2. Download the asset corresponding to your system (e.g., `hardn-linux-amd64`) (e.g., `
curl -LO https://github.com/abbott/hardn/releases/latest/download/hardn-linux-amd64`).
3. Move the downloaded binary to `/usr/local/bin` and set executable permissions:

   ```bash
   # Make executable and move to system path
   chmod +x hardn-linux-amd64
   sudo mv hardn-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/hardn
   
   # Test installation
   sudo hardn -h # help
   ```

### Install From Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/abbott/hardn.git
cd hardn

# Build
make build

# Example distribution (e.g. AMD64)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/hardn cmd/hardn/main.go

# Install
sudo make install
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues:** If you encounter permission errors when writing to `/usr/local/bin`, ensure you‚Äôre running the command with `sudo`.
- **Missing curl:** If `curl` is not installed, use your package manager to install it (e.g., `sudo apt-get install curl` on Debian/Ubuntu).

CLI Examples

```bash
# Run all hardening operations
sudo hardn -r

# Create a non-root user w/SSH access
sudo hardn -u george -c

# Configure firewall
sudo hardn -w

# Enable dry-run mode and preview all operations
sudo hardn -n -r

# Show version information
sudo hardn -v
```

### Configuration File

On first run, `hardn` will offer to create a default configuration file if no existing config is found. The following YAML configuration file locations are searched in order:

1. Path specified with `--config` or `-f` flag
2. Environment variable `HARDN_CONFIG` (if set)
3. `/etc/hardn/hardn.yml` (system-wide configuration)
4. `~/.config/hardn/hardn.yml` (XDG Base Directory specification)
5. `~/.hardn.yml` (traditional dot-file in home directory)
6. `./hardn.yml` (current working directory)

You can specify a different configuration file with the `-f` flag or environment variable:

```bash
# Using command line flag
sudo hardn -f /path/to/custom-config.yml

# Using environment variable
export HARDN_CONFIG=/path/to/custom-config.yml
sudo hardn
```

Example configuration:

```yaml
# User Management
username: "george"
sudoNoPassword: true
sshKeys:
  - "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... george@example.com"

# Network & Security
sshPort: 2208                       # Non-standard SSH port (security measure; Default: 22)
dmzSubnet: "192.168.4"
nameservers:
  - "1.1.1.1"
  - "1.0.0.1"

# Feature Toggles
enableAppArmor: true
enableLynis: true
enableUnattendedUpgrades: true
enableUfwSshPolicy: true
configureDns: true
disableRoot: true
```

## Release Chain Security

[![SLSA 3](https://slsa.dev/images/gh-badge-level3.svg)](https://slsa.dev) [![Signed with Sigstore](https://img.shields.io/badge/Signed%20with-Sigstore-blue)](https://www.sigstore.dev/)

`hardn` implements [SLSA](https://slsa.dev) Level 3 supply chain security for all releases. This provides the following security guarantees:

### SLSA Level 3 Protection

All releases follow the Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) Level 3 requirements, providing:

- **Tamper Protection**: Each binary is signed and includes a provenance attestation
- **Build Integrity**: Builds are performed in GitHub's trusted environment
- **Source Verification**: Binaries are traceable back to their source commit
- **Reproducibility**: The build process is fully documented in the provenance

### Sigstore Artifact Signing

In addition to SLSA provenance, all artifacts are signed using [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/):

- **Cryptographic Verification**: Each binary is signed with ephemeral keys
- **Transparency Logs**: All signatures are recorded in the public Rekor transparency log
- **Identity-based Trust**: Signatures are tied to GitHub's OIDC identity
- **Keyless Verification**: No need to manage or distribute public keys

### Verifying Releases

To verify a `hardn` release with both SLSA provenance and Sigstore signature:

1. Use our verification script:
   ```bash
   # Download and run verification script
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abbott/hardn/main/scripts/verify.sh > verify.sh
   chmod +x verify.sh
   ./verify.sh v0.3.2 linux-amd64
   ```

2. Or verify manually:
   ```bash
   # Install verification tools
   go install github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/v2/cli/slsa-verifier@v2.7.0
   curl -sSL https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/latest/download/cosign-linux-amd64 -o cosign
   chmod +x cosign
   sudo mv cosign /usr/local/bin/
   
   # Download the binary and verification files
   curl -LO https://github.com/abbott/hardn/releases/download/v0.3.2/hardn-linux-amd64
   curl -LO https://github.com/abbott/hardn/releases/download/v0.3.2/hardn-linux-amd64.intoto.jsonl
   curl -LO https://github.com/abbott/hardn/releases/download/v0.3.2/hardn-linux-amd64.sig
   curl -LO https://github.com/abbott/hardn/releases/download/v0.3.2/hardn-linux-amd64.crt
   
   # Verify SLSA provenance
   slsa-verifier verify-artifact \
     --artifact-path hardn-linux-amd64 \
     --provenance hardn-linux-amd64.intoto.jsonl \
     --source-uri github.com/abbott/hardn \
     --source-tag v0.3.2
     
   # Verify Sigstore signature
   cosign verify-blob \
     --certificate hardn-linux-amd64.crt \
     --signature hardn-linux-amd64.sig \
     --certificate-identity-regexp ".*github.com/workflows/.*" \
     --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
     hardn-linux-amd64
   ```

3. Or using our `Makefile` targets:
   ```bash
   # Install tools
   make install-verifier
   make install-cosign
   
   # Verify both SLSA and Sigstore
   make verify-release-full VERSION=0.3.2 OS=linux ARCH=amd64
   ```

A successful verification confirms the binary was built by GitHub Actions from the official `hardn` repository at the specified tag, has a valid signature tied to the GitHub workflow identity, and has not been tampered with since building.

## üß™ Origin

After manually hardening Debian based containers and VMs for years, I wrote and maintained a local script to automate the essentials by way of a config and command line arguments. Within a year, a CLI menu was bolted on and the codebase needed to be refactored to ensure maintainability, so I landed on Go, and decided to publish the tool. Enjoy! ü•É
